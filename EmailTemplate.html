    <p>Hi All,</p>
    <p>We are from the <strong>Cloud App Patching Team</strong>. You are receiving this email because you have been identified as a potential POC, business owner or technical owner of the servers in the table below.</p>

    <p>As part of our ongoing third-party application review, we are assessing the need for <strong>{{AppNames}}</strong> on servers. Our goal is to minimize unnecessary browsers installed on servers and recommend using the default browser <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>.</p>

    <p>Please review the server(s) listed:</p>
    <table border='1' cellpadding='5' cellspacing='0' style='border-collapse:collapse;'>
      <tr style='background-color:#f2f2f2;'><th>Server Name</th></tr>
      {{RowsHtml}}
    </table>

    <p>Please confirm if {{AppNames}} is still required for any applications or processes on these servers. If yes, please let us know the reason why {{AppNames}} is still required, and whether Microsoft Edge is not a suitable alternative for your needs.</p>

    <p>If we do not receive a response by <strong>June 25, 2025</strong>, we will assume {{AppNames}} is no longer needed and proceed with its removal from the listed servers.</p>

    <p>Thank you,</p>
    <p>Regards,<br>
